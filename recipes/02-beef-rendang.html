    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rendang is a rich and tender coconut beef stew originated from the Minangkabau ethnic group of Indonesia. It's often served at ceremonial occasions and to honor guests. This Indonesian dish is prepared with a myriad of herbs and spices cooked for a few hours until all the liquids have been completely absorbed by the meat. Beef rendang is best eaten with steamed rice and condiments such as fried onions and chili pieces.
